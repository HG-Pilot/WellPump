## Pump Logic

The error logic has since been updated and split into separate **Error States**. Each error condition now has its own dedicated state within the system's state machine for better clarity and manageability. Despite this structural change, the core functionality and error-handling mechanisms remain consistent with the original design.

## Program Function and Overview

This program automates the control of a well water pump and water tank filling process using an ESP32 microcontroller.  
It is designed for off-grid cabins, cottages, or any water tank system.  
The software integrates multiple features to ensure efficient operation, user convenience, and system safety:

### Program Features:

- Automated pump control based on tank water levels, well recovery intervals, and timed pumping cycles
- ESP32 hardware timer controls well recovery and pumping intervals
- Well recovery interval allows well water to recover before the next pump cycle begins
- Desired tank water level is configurable; the ToF sensor at the top indicates less distance equals more water
- The ToF sensor takes five consecutive readings, stores them in an array, and calculates the median value after sorting. This approach ensures reliability by tolerating up to two failed reads while providing detailed logs for these occurrences.
- Pump cycles are timed based on your well capacity
- Onboard RGBW LED displays the current operational state of the system
- Logs align with State Machine color states and reflect the same LED colors
- Buzzer, when enabled, provides audible confirmation at the start of each state
- CT coil reads A/C side current draw and can be re-programmed to read DC as well
- Water temperature is updated at intervals and recorded pre- and post-pump cycle to display the delta water temperature
- System time is derived via NTP and supports time zones and DST
- Approximate tank fill percentage is displayed for semi-circular tanks
- System uptime is calculated and displayed
- Program states and errors feature verbose logging, timestamping, and color coding
- ADS calibration adjusts the CT current value
- Dark and light UI modes ensure optimal readability on mobile and desktop devices

### Safety Features:

- Stuck pump relay detection logic uses a second relay for emergency pump disconnect
- Overfilling is prevented with a critical water level check using a moisture sensor
- In the event of a ToF sensor failure or inability to retrieve a valid reading after two attempts, the system transitions into a **Yellow Error State**, ensuring safety and preventing erroneous operations.
- Over- and under-current pump protection avoids burning out or dry-running the pump
- Hysteresis threshold prevents rapid pump cycling when the tank is nearly full
- System events are logged with a circular buffer, enabling review and troubleshooting

### Connectivity Features:

- Two WiFi modes: STA (if configured) and AP (as a fallback or if STA is disabled)
- Web server on port 80 provides real-time data tracking, program control, and configuration
- NTP time synchronization operates in STA mode when connected to the internet


## Flashing and Compiling

This code can be compiled using Arduino IDE version 2.3.6 or higher, provided all necessary libraries are installed and dependencies are resolved. The external RTTTL library, included in the Data folder, must be installed manually. For the VL53L0X sensor, search for "Pololu VL53L0X" in the Library Manager to add the required library.

For a simpler approach, if you are using an ESP32-S3-DEVKITC-1-N16R8, you can flash pre-compiled firmware directly using the `flash.cmd` script located at [https://github.com/HG-Pilot/WellWaterPump/tree/main/build](https://github.com/HG-Pilot/WellWaterPump/tree/main/build). To proceed, connect your ESP32 to your computer, identify the assigned COM port (you may need to install drivers for the onboard USB-to-UART chip), and execute the `flash.cmd` script. Enter the COM port number in uppercase as prompted, then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the flashing process.
